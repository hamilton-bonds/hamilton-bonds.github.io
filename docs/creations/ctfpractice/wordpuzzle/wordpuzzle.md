# WordPuzzle
There is a server dispatching a secret message.  Find the message and decode it to get the flag!

To setup training, run the server [wordpuzzle.py](https://hamilton-bonds.github.io/creations/ctfpractice/wordpuzzle/wordpuzzle.py).  The clients (trainees) will use [wp_client.py](https://hamilton-bonds.github.io/creations/ctfpractice/wordpuzzle/wp_client.py)

Solution on request.

## [50] Over Time: Paid (Cryptography)

### Prompt:

After many months of hard work by our agents, we've gained access to a sensitive payroll document from a competitor. Unfortunately, it looks heavily encrypted. document.encrypted source.py

### Initial Analysis:

When first looking at the file source.py, the first thing that stands out is that the code is prefaced with a list of words and two predefined variables "INTRO" and "OUTRO".  For any crypto problem, known text significantly simplifies the problem-solving process.

The next thing to note is how encrypt_otp functions:

```
def encrypt_otp(data):
    d = data.encode('utf-8')
    otp = bytes(os.urandom(64))
    out = []
    for i in range(0, len(d)):
        out.append(d[i] ^ otp[i % len(otp)])
    return bytes(out)
```

encrypt_otp takes in data, which is effectively a combination of "INTRO", selections from the list "words", "OUTRO", and then the flag.  The data is then XOR'd against the 64-byte Unicode-Random one-time pad (OTP) with the caret operator (^), byte-by-byte.

Seeing that the INTRO is 65 bytes in length, we can deduce the OTP from a known input by looking at the first 64 bytes of document.encrypted.  From there, we decrypt the document with the given OTP, as XOR is a two-way operation; that is, if a^b=c, then c^b=a.

### Solution:

For single-byte XOR problems, I like to start by generating a list of single-byte hex combinations.

```keylist = [hex(x)[2:].zfill(2) for x in range(256)]```

Import the data from document.encrypted:

```
hexlist = list()
with open('document.encrypted','r') as infile:
    for line in infile:
        hexlist.extend([line.strip()[i:i+2] for i in range(0,len(line),2)])
    infile.close()
```

Then, create a list of characters from the hex values:

```
unhexd_list = list()
for hc in hexlist:
    unhexd_list.append(binascii.unhexlify(hc.zfill(2)))
```

I created two functions to handle finding the OTP and then subsequently decrypting the file as discussed in the analysis:

```
def getOTP(INTRO,unhexd_list,keylist):
    otp = list()
    sample_in = INTRO[:64]
    sample_out = unhexd_list[:64]
    for i,char in enumerate(sample_in):
        char = char.encode('utf-8')
        for key in keylist:
            kb = bytes.fromhex(key)
            result = char[0] ^ kb[0]
            result = bytes([result])
            if result.hex() == sample_out[i].hex():
                otp.append(kb)
    return otp

def decode(message,otp):
    out = list()
    otp_ctr = 0
    for z,m in enumerate(message):
        if z % 64 == 0:
            otp_ctr = 0
        xl = m
        xr = otp[otp_ctr]
        out.append(chr(xl[0] ^ xr[0]))
        otp_ctr += 1
    return out
```

How getOTP works is visualized below:

	33 6b 20 62 6f 6e 75 73

 FUNCT: Does 54^00 == OUTPUT[0]?...Does 54^FF == OUTPUT[0]?
        If yes, add the correct XOR key piece to the OTP.
        Does 68^00 == OUTPUT[1]?...Does 68^FF == OUTPUT[1]?
	If yes, add the correct XOR key piece to the OTP.
	..
	Does 73^00 == OUTPUT[63]?..Does 73^FF == OUTPUT[63]?
```

Finally, the main:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    otp = getOTP(INTRO,unhexd_list,keylist)
    original = decode(unhexd_list,otp)
    print(''.join(original))
```

And there you have it!

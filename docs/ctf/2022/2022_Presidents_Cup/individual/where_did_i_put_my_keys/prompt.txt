NOTE
This challenge can take about three (3) minutes to launch and configure.

Background
On August 16, a high-ranking employee in charge of securing many of our servers has shut down our access to a cube drive manufacturing facility's main server.

The attacker left an encrypted attack script alongside every other employee’s SSH key pairs. We believe the attacker used one of the collected SSH key pairs to encrypt a python script using 256-bit AES and cipher-block chaining. To prevent further compromise, we reset the SSH keys used for authentication.

Additional evidence shows the attacker was using the ssh-access workstation and the username remote-user to upload python or shell scripts to ftp-server.us. The scripts were automatically executed upon upload.

The image below shows the connections we suspect the attacker is capable of making.

Getting Started
You’ve been given access to ourkali-workstation and credentials to user on ftp-server.us. The FTP access you are given contains the resources you need.

We need you to:

Determine which SSH key pair was used to encrypt the attacker's script. Use the decrypted script to login to the ssh-access machine.
Utilize the ssh-access machine to login to the ftp-server using the remote-user.
Use the access you gained to login to the secure-server and retrieve the token.
System and Tool Credentials

Note
Attacking or unauthorized access to challenge.us (10.5.5.5) is forbidden.

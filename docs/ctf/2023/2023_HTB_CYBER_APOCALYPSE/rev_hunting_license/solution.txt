So, you want to be a relic hunter?
First, you're going to need your license, and for that you need to pass the exam.
It's short, but it's not for the faint of heart. Are you up to the challenge?! (y/n)
y        
Okay, first, a warmup - what's the first password? This one's not even hidden: PasswordNumeroUno
Getting harder - what's the second password? P4ssw0rdTw0
Your final test - give me the third, and most protected, password: ThirdAndFinal!!!
Well done hunter - consider yourself certified!

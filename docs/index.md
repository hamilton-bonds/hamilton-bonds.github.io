## Proofs of Concept

### Zoomer
At the onset of COVID-19, life turned virtual and people flocked to Zoom.  In an effort to ensure user safety, I investigated and presented flaws in Zoom's implementation regarding CAPTCHA.  Zoom has since corrected this issue, justifying the release of this Proof of Concept video.

## Creations

### Training Material
In order to increase the technical competence of my team, I created custom challenges that progressively developed each team member's ability to solve cyber problems with creative coding approaches.
- [Beginner 1](https://hamilton-bonds.github.io/creations/ctfpractice/02October2020/beginner_1/beginner_1.html) is a good problem for Cyber operators to get used to the format of CTF problems.
- [Bashing](https://hamilton-bonds.github.io/creations/ctfpractice/bashing/bashing.html) is a program designed to encourage good CTF habits.
- [Nuclear Savior](https://hamilton-bonds.github.io/creations/ctfpractice/nuclearsavior/nuclearsavior.html) builds confidence in solving cryptography problems.  Working the problem was fun and engaging enough to make the concepts stick.
- [Word Puzzle](https://hamilton-bonds.github.io/creations/ctfpractice/wordpuzzle/wordpuzzle.html) is a way to practice interacting with raw sockets in Python.

## Endorsements

## Proofs of Concept

### Zoomer
At the onset of COVID-19, life turned virtual and people flocked to Zoom.  In an effort to ensure user safety, I investigated and presented flaws in Zoom's implementation regarding CAPTCHA.  Zoom has since corrected this issue, justifying the release of this Proof of Concept video.
